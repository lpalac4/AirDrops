        The plane class is a subclass of an AirborneObject which has the capabilities of adjusting its
        acceleration and angle of momemtum.  It also is capable of creating new objects including
        bullets, rockets, cannon shells, and bombs when the ui detects the user pressing the appropriate 
        keys.
